🧠 AI-Powered Research Assistant using LangChain and Chain of Thought Prompting
📘 Overview

This project demonstrates an AI-based Research Assistant built using the LangChain framework and Chain of Thought Prompting Strategy.
The system integrates multiple components for intelligent information retrieval, reasoning, and summarization.
It leverages Google Gemini API, ChromaDB, and DuckDuckGo Search to create a structured, explainable, and accurate research workflow.

🚀 Features

🤖 Multi-Agent Design – Includes Writer, Reviewer, Synthesizer, Retriever, and Query Planner agents.

🧩 Chain of Thought Prompting – Enables structured reasoning and better factual accuracy.

🔍 Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) – Uses ChromaDB for context-aware document retrieval.

🌐 Real-Time Web Search – Integrates DuckDuckGo Search for external information access.

🧠 LLM Integration – Powered by Google Gemini API through LangChain.

📊 Evaluation Metrics – Supports faithfulness and recall checks (RAGAS concepts).

💻 Google Colab Compatible – Easy to run, modify, and experiment with interactive notebooks.
